# Parse-Naval-Vessel-Registry-in-Python
A python script that captures all the ship detail data published from https://www.nvr.navy.mil and exporting the results as csv and .feather file formats.

This script works as of 2022/07/18, any changes to the site will break this script.

If nvr.navy.mil ever exposes a public API, use that in favor of this web scraping tool.
